          The Internet is a massive, global system of interconnected computer
          networks, a "network of networks," that uses the standard TCP/IP
          protocol suite to link devices worldwide, enabling instant
          communication, data sharing (like email, web pages via WWW,
          streaming), and access to vast information. Originating from the US
          military's ARPANET project in 1969, it grew through academic networks
          and private systems into the public resource it is today,
          fundamentally changing how we access information, shop, learn, and
          connect.

        <p>
          The internet's history began in the 1960s with the U.S. military's
          ARPANET, a decentralized network for research, evolving with the
          adoption of the crucial TCP/IP protocol in 1983, which allowed diverse
          networks to connect. The invention of the World Wide Web by Tim
          Berners-Lee in 1989, along with graphical browsers like Mosaic in the
          early 90s, made it user-friendly, leading to rapid commercialization,
          the rise of search engines, social media, and smartphones,
          transforming global communication and commerce by the 21st century.

        <p>
          The internet works as a massive, global network of interconnected
          computers, using protocols like TCP/IP to send information in small
          "packets" between devices, from your phone to a server miles away.
          When you type a website address, your Internet Service Provider (ISP)
          directs your request through routers and switches across vast networks
          of fiber-optic cables and wireless signals to find the server holding
          the data, which then sends the webpage back to you, making everything
          from emails to videos instantly accessible.
        </p>
        <p>Here's a simple breakdown of how it functions:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Connection</b>: Your device (computer, phone) connects to a modem
            and router, linking you to your ISP.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Request</b>: You type a URL (like www.google.com) in your
            browser, sending a request for data.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Routing</b>: Your ISP sends this request across the internet's
            backbone - a web of interconnected networks (private, public,
            academic, business).
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Packet Switching</b>: Data travels as tiny packets, each finding
            the most efficient path through routers and switches, allowing the
            network to function even if parts are down.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Server Response</b>: The packets reach the server hosting the
            website, which sends the requested information back to you in
            packets.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Assembly</b>: Your browser receives these packets and reassembles
            them to display the webpage.
          </li>
        </ol>
